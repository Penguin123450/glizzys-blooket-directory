# Hackinator

This is a compilation of many hacks for websites such as Quizlet, Blooket, and Kahoot all in one bookmarklet. I did not make any of these, and credit to original creator should be found in the bookmarklet (hopefully).

Bookmarklet:
```
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penguin123450/hackinator/main/js").then((res)=> res.text().then((t) => eval(t)))
```
